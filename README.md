### Hi there 👋
I'm Derek, a professor at NYU teaching Machine Learning in Financial Engineering

- My interests are in synthetic data generation, agent-based simulators, and asset management using machine learning. 
- I have worked on projects at HSBC, G-Research, Alan Turing Insitute, Oxford-MAN Institute and other large quantitative funds.
